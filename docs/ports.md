## List of ports by number

Only used ports are listed.

### Port 0x00 (screen memory location)

* Direction: write
* Default value: `0x00`
* Requires shadow: *Yes*

**Note**: This port is only usd in "new" Mailstations!

Bits 0-5 set the 256-byte page in the `0xC000` area where the screen memory starts. Therefore `0x00` means `0xC000`, `0x01` means `0xC100` and so on.

The CPU mirrors all writes to the screen area and sends them directly to the LCD controller. This mechanism is not used in "old" Mailstations, which use memory-mapped LCD controllers.

### Port 0x01 (keyboard scan)

* Direction: read/write
* Default value: `0x00`
* Requires shadow: No

Value written to this port sets the keyboard row bits 0-7. Value read from this port gets the keyboard column bits 0-7.

Because the keyboard matrix has 10 rows, the remaining two rows are controlled by bits 1-0 of port `0x02`.

By default, the firmware writes `0x00` to this register, to enable reading from all rows at once. This way, any value read other than `0xFF` indicates that some key is pressed, anf the 64 Hz interrupt routine can proceed with testing the whole keyboard matrix.

### Port 0x02 (GPIO group 1)

* Direction: read/write (depending on bit direction)
* Default value: `0xA4`
* Requires shadow: **Yes**

Individual GPIO bits in this port have the following purpose:

| Bit | Direction | Description |
| --- | --------- | ----------- |
| 7   | Output    | LCD enable |
| 6   | Input     | Caller ID data [^1] |
| 5   | Output    | Modem power on |
| 4   | Output    | New email LED |
| 3   | Output    | LCD controller column latch |
| 2   | Input     | Caller ID ready [^1] |
| 1   | Output    | Keyboard matrix row 9 |
| 0   | Output    | Keyboard matrix row 8 |

### Port 0x03 (Interrupt mask)

* Direction: read/write
* Default value: `0x22`
* Requires shadow: **Yes**

Writing the registers enables or disabled specific interrupts. Reading shows which interrupts are pending.

Acknowledging an interrupt is done by disabling it, the enabling again.

| Bit | Interrupt source |
| --- | ---------------- |
| 7   | Caller ID |
| 6   | Modem |
| 5   | Real Time Clock |
| 4   | 1 Hz timer |
| 3   | Unused |

| 1   | 64 Hz timer |
| 0   | Unused |

### Port 0x0A (GPIO group 2 direction)

* Direction: write
* Default value: `0x0F`
* Requires shadow: No
* See also: [Port 0x09](#port-0x09-gpio-group-2)

Pin direction for port `0x09` (0 = input, 1 = output).

### Port 0x0B (GPIO group 1 direction)

* Direction: write
* Default value: `0xFF`
* Requires shadow: No
* See also: [Port 0x02](#port-0x02-gpio-group-1)

### Port 0x0C (unknown)

* Direction: unknown
* Default value: *none*
* Requires shadow: Unknown

Unknown purpose, but most bits can be set or cleared. Reads `0xE3` after reset.

### Port 0x0D (CPU clock speed)

* Direction: write
* Default value: `0x32`
* Requires shadow: *Yes*

Bits 4 and 6 set the CPU cpeed:

| Value | Speed  |
| 00    | 12 MHz |
| 01    | 12 MHz |
| 10    | 12 MHz |
| 11    | 8 MHz  |

Bits 1-2 set the frequency of the level 1 IRQ:

| Value | Frequency |
| 00    | 128 Hz    |
| 01    | 64 Hz     |
| 10    | 32 Hz     |
| 11    | 16 Hz     |

The maning of other bits is not known. Thus, setting the default value of `0x32` sets CPu speed to 10 MHz (bit 6 = 0, bit 4 = 1) and interrupt frequency to 64 Hz (bit 1 = 1, bit 0 = 0).

### Port 0x10 (RTC seconds low)

| --- | ----------- |
| 3   | 1 = Timer enable |
| 2   | 1 = Alarm enable |
| 1   | Page number bit 1 |
| 0   | Page number bit 0 |

The page selection determines what data is read/written to registers `0x10-0x1C`:

| ---- | ---------- |
| 0    | Timer |
| 1    | Alarm, clock format, leap year |
| 2    | Static ram 1 |
| 3    | Static ram 2 |

| 3   | 0 = 1 Hz interrupt enable |
| 2   | 0 = 16 Hz interrupt enable |
| 1   | 1 = timer reset |
| 0   | 1 = alarm reset |

### Port 0x20 (GPIO group 3 copy)

* Direction: read
* Default value: *none*

* Default value: *none*
* Requires shadow: No

This port is used exclusively for reading printer status lines:

Pin direction for port `0x28` (0 = input, 1 = output)

### Port 0x2C (GPIO group 5 direction)

* Direction: write
* Default value: `0xFF`
* Requires shadow: No
* See also: [Port 0x2D](#port-0x2d-gpio-group-5)

### Port 0x2D (GPIO group 5)

* Direction: write
* Default value: `0x00`
* Requires shadow: No

This port controls the eight printer port data lines.

### Port 0x2F (IRQ speed)

* Direction: read/write
* Default value: `0x80`
* Requires shadow: No

Bit 7 is set by firmware very early in the reset procedure, the purpose of this is not know.

Bits 4-6 set the rate of the level 4 IRQ:

| Value | Rate |
| ----- | ---- |
| 000   | 1s   |
| 001   | Disabled |
| 010   | Disabled |
| 011   | Disabled |
| 100   | 1s   |
| 101   | 2s   |
| 110   | 4s   |
| 111   | 8s   |

Setting bits 2 and 3 seem to affect I/O lines in a strange way, switching off the LCD and LED (possibly disabling the I/O ports or tristating them?).

Bits 0 and 1 seem to have no effect.

# Footnotes

[^1]: Firmware code reads these bits, but by default they are set as outputs.

[^2]: Firmware code reads this bit, but the purpose is not fully understood. It is connected to pin 3 of U603 on the motherboard.
