A lot of the information has been taken from Kris Bahnsen's Mailstation Wiki available at [https://github.com/kbembedded/mailstation/wiki/]. The information was originally collected by the members of the (now defunct) Mailstation Yahoo Group and linux-hackers.net forum, including Rogblake2000, FyberOptic, Cyrano Jones, jmareksr, John Hogerhuis, and others.
